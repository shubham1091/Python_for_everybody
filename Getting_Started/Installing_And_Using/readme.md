# Installin And Using Python

In this module you will set things up so you can write Python programs. Not all activities in this module are required for this<br> 
class so please read the "Using Python in this Class" material for details.

## Important Reading: Using Python in this Class

We strongly encourage you to install Python on your computer if you have a desktop or laptop.  There are even some<br> 
Python applications available for iPhone and Android phones.

But if you do not have a computer where you can install Python, you can still complete this class because we have a <br>
version of Python that runs in your browser that is sufficient to do the assignments for this class.

You will see various links that allow you to develop, turn in and auto-grade each of the programming assignments <br>
throughout the class. You can also use the <span style ="color: #4287f5">"Python Playground"</span> to experiment with writing your own Python <br>
applications using only your browser.

We feel that you learn the most if you develop your applications using the actual Python environment and then use our <br>
browser-based system to turn in your applications after they are completed.  But we do understand that not everyone <br>
can install Python on their computers.

If you are planning on taking all of the courses in the "Python for Everybody" specialization, you will be required to <br>
eventually install and use Python on your own computer as the assignments become more complex.

None of the videos or assignments are required in this week.  So don't worry about getting all the "check boxes" or <br>
completing the progress bar for this week.  Simply use what you want and need to use.
