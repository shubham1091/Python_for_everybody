## Chapter One: Why We Program (continued)

In the first chapter we try to cover the "big picture" of programming so you get a "table of contents" of the rest of the book.<br>
Don't worry if not everything makes perfect sense the first time you hear it. This chapter is quite broad and you would <br>
benefit from reading the chapter in the book in addition to watching the lectures to help it all sink in. You might want to <br >
come back and re-watch these lectures after you have funished a few more chapters.
