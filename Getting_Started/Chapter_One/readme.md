# Chapter one

These are the course-wide materials as well as the first part of Chapter One where we explore what it means to write 
programs. We finish Chapter One and have the quiz and first assignment in the third week of the class. Throughout the 
course you may want to come back and look at these materials. This section should not take you an entire week.

## Reading: Welcome to The Class

Welcome to Getting Started with Python, the first class in our Python for Everybody Specialization.  We have built this 
class specifically for those with no prior programming experience.   With a relatively simple book, and basic exercises 
that focus on the core concepts of programming, we hope that you will gain a solid understanding of the topics in this 
course and be well prepared to take the rest of the courses in the specialization.

We expect that someone who knows another programming language and is just trying to learn Python should be able 
to go through the material in this class in 2-3 weeks, while someone with no programming will take 5-6 weeks.  Please 
take your time and learn these concepts well, as there is little value rushing towards the later classes without proper 
preparation.

We keep this first section as a source of course-wide material so you can come back and reference it as you need to 
throughout the class.

## Course Syllabus

**Welcome to Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)**, taught by Charles Severance!

This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python. We cover the basics of how 
one constructs a program from a series of simple instructions in Python.  The course has no pre-requisites and avoids 
all but the simplest mathematics. Anyone with moderate computer experience should be able to master the materials 
in this course. This course will cover Chapters 1-5 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.  Once a student completes 
this course, they will be ready to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Python 3.

## Participation Strategies

Engaged learning looks different for everybody. In this course, we hope you will define your own measures of success 
and engage with the material in a way that best suits your needs. We recognize and celebrate the diverse ways learners 
engage in courses. As you go through this course, we hope you will reflect on your unique skills, needs, and aspirations, 
and engage in the course material in a way that aligns with your own goals. While the course provides time estimates 
for completion, you should feel empowered to engage in the material in whatever ways make sense to you.
