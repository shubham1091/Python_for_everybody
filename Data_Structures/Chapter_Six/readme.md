# Chapter Six: Strings
In this class, we pick up where we left off in the previous class, starting in Chapter 6 <br>
of the textbook and covering Strings and moving into data structures. The second week of <br>
this class is dedicated to getting Python installed if you want to actually run the <br>
applications on your desktop or laptop. If you choose not to install Python, you can just<br> 
skip to the third week and get a head start.
